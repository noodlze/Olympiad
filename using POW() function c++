When doing integer powers i.e. 10^2 and you use the pow() function, there may be errors when rounding off the double vlaue to 
a integer value(so you get 99 instead of 100):

**Solution 1**:
In general (but not always), when you convert doubles to integers, you call round(). Eg:
int i = (int) round(pow(10,j));
If your C library doesn't have this, you can emulate:
#define round(x) floor((x)+0.5)

__COMMENTS__: I use ceil(pow(a,b)), it works for the question B. Little Dima and Equation


**Solution 2**:
Write a proper integer power function, or when the exponent is known, just write out the multiplication directly i.e 10*10 to 
calculate 10^2.
ll poww(ll a, ll b)
{
    ll res = 1;
    for(int i = 1; i<=b; ++i)
        res *= a;

    return res;
}
